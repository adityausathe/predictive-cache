===============================================
GSP (Generalized Sequential Pattern) algorithm
===============================================

GSP algorithm made with Python3 to deal with arrays as transactions.

Example:

transactions = [
                ['Bread', 'Milk'],
                ['Bread', 'Diaper', 'Beer', 'Eggs'],
                ['Milk', 'Diaper', 'Beer', 'Coke'],
                ['Bread', 'Milk', 'Diaper', 'Beer'],
                ['Bread', 'Milk', 'Diaper', 'Coke']
            ]
